My solutions for the first 9 days of AoC. Note nothing was optimized for except typing speed so the solutions are hard to read and often inefficient. Also sometimes the part 2 solution overwrote the part 1 solution.

## Rust Hello World

This repository also includes a simple "Hello World" program written in Rust, located in the `rust_hello` directory.

### Running the Rust Program

To run the Rust program, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed. If you don't have them installed, you can get them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

Once Rust is installed, you can run the program with these commands:

```bash
cd rust_hello
cargo run
```

This will compile and execute the Hello World program.
